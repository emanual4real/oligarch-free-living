We consumers are the aggressive treatment for Musk, and we have to deprive him of the very things he craves: power and money. That means we should punish any brand or company that partners with the South African Nazi.\nIf you have a Tesla, get rid of it. If you own Tesla stock, sell it. If you’re a Starlink customer and have an alternative, use it. If you are in a position to decide on vendors for your employer or business, don’t award business to Tesla, Starlink, SpaceX, X, The Boring Company or Neuralink.\nDelete your X account. I know many people have kept their accounts to stay up to date on what the Nazi contingent is doing. You need to recognize that Musk is monetizing your attention and his clout in the White House. Business Insider claims advertisers, once concerned with the hate espoused on the platform, are returning to the platform. According to Ad Age, Comcast, IBM, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Lionsgate Entertainment have resumed advertising on President Elon’s hate forum.\nInteresting note: earlier this month, X settled with Trump for $10 million over Twitter banning his account following the January 6th Capitol insurrection. If that seems like a straight-up bribe, that’s because it is.\nIf citizens want to know what DOGE is doing, they have to have an X account. This is a massive conflict of interest and one that is serving Apartheid Clyde well. When Musk purchased then-Twitter, he paid $44 billion for the platform. Most on Wall Street agree he over-paid for the asset. He also took on $13 billion in debt when he bought the platform. Why? Because billionaires don’t want to spend their own money when they can so easily spend someone else’s. In this case, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Barclays, Mitsubishi and others lent Musk the money.\nUntil very recently, that debt was known as the worst buyout for banks since the 2008 financial crisis because the acquisition was WAY overvalued. Given Musk’s new role as President of the United States and him using X as the only official communication channel for the federal government, X’s debt is now worth par — meaning the company isn’t worth less than he paid for it.\nFunny how rigging the system works, huh?",

Officials believe that he sits on a fortune of about $5 billion dollars, but regardless if that’s accurate or not, he’s still the richest person in North Korea. Kim and his ruling party (when they aren’t threatening the world with nuclear attacks) just pull the worst stuff ever. Sure the other people on our list might be bad folks, but they aren’t tied to widespread corruption, the starvation of millions of people, not letting any citizen leave the country, brainwashing, killing who knows how many people, and setting up legitimate death and concentration camps. It’s incredible to think that a country like North Korea exists in todays world, and it’s probably the worst place ever. Just read up on some stories about people who managed to escape the death camps and North Korea to learn about the horrors from within (we’re talking about rape, cannibalism, flogging of children, torture, forcing people to work until they die, etc). Apparently if you’re found guilty of a “crime”, specifically crimes that relate to “insulting” Kim’s name, the government not only arrests you, but your entire family. They’ll even put your cousins and uncles into death camps if you’re arrested. So yeah, I would say Kim Jong-un is probably the most hated billionaire ever.",
